# Project Milestone 2


## this is just a first draft for the readme. to get a basic  idea of what we are gonna do. its gonna have to be structured differently for the M2 submission 

## Project Discussion

This project aims to explore two key factors that contribute to a movie's box office success: **actor fame** and **movie plot complexity**. By analyzing both components, we seek to answer the central question: **What is more important for a movie’s financial success—actor fame or the complexity of the plot?**

We will use two main approaches in this analysis:
1. **Sentiment Analysis** to evaluate movie plot complexity.
2. **Social Network Analysis** to assess actor fame and influence.

In the first part, we'll apply **sentiment analysis** to movie plot summaries to analyze emotional tones and plot complexity. In the second part, we'll use **social network analysis** to measure the impact of actor fame by examining their connections within the film industry. By comparing these two factors, we aim to determine which has a greater influence on box office performance.

We will build upon the work of previous groups, using their methodologies as a foundation:

### 1. Predicting Box Office Success Using Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

This part of the project focuses on discovering patterns within plot summaries that correlate with box office performance. By applying **sentiment analysis**, we aim to extract emotional tones (positive, negative, neutral) from summaries, providing insights into audience reactions. Additionally, machine learning techniques will be used to analyze factors such as genre, key emotional terms, and plot length to predict box office success.

Key questions:
- Do highly ranked movies share a common lexical field, creating a recipe for success?
- Do movies with more positive summaries tend to perform better at the box office?
- Are emotionally complex or ambiguous movies harder to market?

### 2. Social Network Analysis of Actors - The Impact of Actor Fame

This part of the project aims to identify influential actors over time by constructing a **social network** where nodes represent actors and edges represent the movies they've appeared in together. Using network analysis metrics such as **degree centrality** (number of connections), **closeness** (proximity within the network), and **betweenness centrality** (actors who bridge different clusters), we can reveal which actors become central figures in the industry.

We may also perform time-series analysis to track how an actor’s influence changes over the years and analyze how working with specific directors or studios might affect their career trajectory. This can help predict trends like the resurgence of "has-been" actors or future award winners.

### Main Question: The Impact of Actor Fame vs. Plot Complexity on Box Office Revenue

This project aims to analyze whether the financial success of a movie depends more on the **fame of its actors** or the **complexity of its plot**. Many modern blockbusters rely heavily on star-studded casts, sometimes at the expense of narrative depth. On the other hand, films with intricate plots but lesser-known actors may struggle at the box office but still achieve critical acclaim.

This analysis will compare movies that feature prominent actors in simple, predictable plots with those that have more complex narratives but lesser-known actors. The goal is to understand how these factors contribute to box office performance.

Key questions:
- How do we evaluate the complexity of a movie's plot?
- How much does star power contribute to a movie's box office success?
- What trends can be observed in balancing actor fame with narrative depth to determine box office hits?
